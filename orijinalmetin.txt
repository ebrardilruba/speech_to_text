What tags away the letter ?
Oh, negative sir, we're on 2-2-right holding shot of Poxot.
What tags away do you enter the ramp?
Okay, sir, we just exit the runway and we're holding shot of Poxot on 2-2-right.
You're not listening to what I'm asking you. What tags away do you enter the ramp?
I'm not on the ramp yet, sir.
What tags away do you enter the ramp? Tell me, what letter?
Okay, we can enter at a kilo for SCR 503.
That's all I need to get out of you. We talk like six times.
Straight ahead and more shuttle, sir.
Straight ahead and more shuttle, sir.
Follow me as Gianna and next time I would like you to be polite with me.
Okay, but if I gotta talk to you six times, then I got all the people I gotta talk to,
and you don't understand what I'm saying.
You don't understand what I'm saying, polite with me, all right?
You wanna polite with me?
I'll make a report.
Go ahead.
2-9, we're trying to clear a weapon on the one way.
Roger, we're holding shot of Poxot on 2-2-right.
Crazy rabbit.
You know, I've seen stranger things, so it might have happened.
And then, you know, we just asked Continental, who was the last airplane to land,
if he saw it and he did not.
So it might have dissipated on its own accord.
It was 5-99, runway 2-9 are cleared for takeoff.
And half of it was 5-99, cleared for takeoff, runway 2-9.
Thanks, Hill.
Feel like an idiot and maintain the visual with the photo.
You're still clear to land 3-5.
Affirmative, Steve, I'll place you in place, sir.
Affirmative, I'm an idiot, or that you're gonna maintain the visual?
No comment.
15th individual, sir, please, please, sir.
Yeah, my wife would have jumped on the first one, thanks.
Eagle flight, 8-18, contact Departure, I've got all these down.
Say, baby.
Departure, Departure, we'll go ahead and get it.
And what is it, you know?
You know, I really don't know.
It looks like a really thick rat, but it might be some mill.
That's a New York rat.
First-class meal.
Call catering.
Oh, you'd better face the floods, sir, because if you're looking at the passengers
and trying to fly, they get scared.
That's a good point.
Taxes 532, head for...
Taxes 532, Kennedy Fair, runway 3, all must act kilo, kilo, position and hold.
Hold that, plus traffic departing, runway 2-2, right.
Okay, position and hold, 3-1 left at kilo, kilo, taxi 532.
Button's jammed, go back to the body.
Oh, Jesus.
The button's gone, guys.
Um, got me that today, X-ray, gold filter, uh...
3048, continue up the flight level, all 3-3-0.
2-8-3-0.
New York Tower, hello, we're at Eagle flight, 44-0-0.
We are at the visual, 1-3 left.
44-4, again, I have to know your number 1, Colana, 1-3 left.
Colana, 1-3 left, Eagle flight, 44-0-0.
Position, hold, 2-2, right, come here, 4th.
At the bottom of a super-local.
Lot of wheels.
There you go.
I'll wait for you to see, uh, number 2, Vanyos Airbus.
Sorry, 737, my bad.
All right, Rex.
I'm just, you guys, fine, Airbus is over time.
Hey, not us.
Yeah, here we go, man, you guys are 737.
Hey, we bought a real airplane.
That was Delta, uh, say that again, please.
Delta, 2991, you said you're 11 hours from Palm Beach.
I have holiday, so it's on Lardell.
Okay, yep, wrong frequency.
Uh, 2945, we got somebody standing up in the plane.
Are you gonna be able to go to the next, like, 30 seconds?
Well, 2945, we need to stay on the runway.
We got somebody in the restroom.
We don't know when they're gonna come out.
Stand by.
We have, like, 668, go around,
start runway heading, maintain 1,500.
Fever 179, heavy, no delay.
Cross four, left, right, Bravo, monitor ground, 0.9.
Good night.
Okay, no delay.
Cross four, left, right, Bravo, 0.9.
Bye.
You going back out tonight?
Uh, let's see.
Well, if you do, we'll give you, uh,
free, get out of jail, free pass,
we'll send you straight to the front.
Oh, that's fine.
It's out of the 411.
And, uh, need your credit card
and, uh, the expiration date, wrong with that.
Yeah, sure.
Jazz, 1744, do you read?
You stupid fucking b***h.
Jazz, 77, 79, cleared to 11,000.
Okay, what the hell's going on here?
God damn it.
Jazz, 77, 79, cleared to 11,000.
And departure, Jazz, 74, 40, do you read?
Jazz, 78, 40, 411, 233, 21, have you read to me?
Uh, we've got to three by three,
but there's an open mic on the frequency.
We're about to 6323 on the freezing point
over to departure.
Happy turkey day.
You do the same, sir.
Reasing point, climb over to departure.
Gobble, gobble, gobble.
Departure, good holiday.
See you.
Departure, we'll see you all next time.
Hello, departure, it is to talk
with 7767, bounding with excitement
out of 2,900 for 5,000 runway heading.
14,077, 67.
1985, have a blast.
12 plus 25, 47.
Where you going?
Sure, it was nice.
Hey, it's back there.
Now, you need to make a 180, yeah?
You passed it all.
What did they move it?
They didn't.
They, uh, some of us used to park up
on the north side there,
but then now they all park down here,
just being on mic.
Yeah, one hotel box.
Is it about Langster?
Do you want us to go, uh,
Baisley, triple hangers?
One hotel box truck.
Okay, we'll see why the Baisley route.
Most of the ones we left on the triple hangers
traffic behind you in Donalema, 13 miles.
All right, Roger.
We could come in to say the powwows.
That's easier for you.
If it was easier, I would have given it to you.
All right, we're just trying to figure out
what you want.
Actually, you know what?
I made a mistake.
Your sequence is on Juliet.
It's a challenger, right on Juliet.
Just get behind him in, uh, 23, uh, 9,
and that airbus will still follow you
from the left on Zool.
Yeah, if you don't tell us to give way,
uh, technically, we can go ahead and hit him, right?
Right.
That does so.
